# Integrated Design Project - Part 1B Engineering Tripos

## What is it about
This is a 2-3 week project run at the start of the 2nd Year of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. During our year the task was to build a robot that would be able to pick 'parcels' of different colours and deliver them to their destination (1 of 2 trucks) with each color corresponding to a specific destination. The project was done in a team of 6 with 2 people in each subteam (Electrical, Mechanical, Software) 

## What is contained in this repo?
In this repo you will find two folders **/IDPPlayground** and **/Software**. All the files used in the final version of the project are located inside the **/Software** folder, inlcuding any test files. The **/IDPPlayground** folder contains experimentations that may have or have not been included in the final version of the project. 

The **.Software** folders also contains the following:

* **./main/** : Inside this folder you will find the main C++ programm as well as the compiled version (for the Armv8 processor)
* **./modules/** : This folder contains a list of header files which contain dependencies and helper functions corresponding to each component of the robots software
* **./test/** : This folder contains all the different tests run on the robot.
